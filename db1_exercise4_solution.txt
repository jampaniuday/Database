Aggregating, Grouping
---------------------

-- Study the following query and its result.
-- You can see the behaviour of aggregating functions. 
SELECT count(comm), count(*), count(sal), count(distinct sal), 
       sum(sal), sum(distinct sal), trunc(avg(sal)), avg(distinct sal)
FROM nikovits.emp WHERE ename like '%O%';


Queries for the following tables (see description of the columns in previous exrcises)
--------------------------------

NIKOVITS.DEPT(deptno, dname, loc)
NIKOVITS.SAL_CAT(category, lowest_sal, highest_sal)
