NYU Center for Data Science

https://cds.nyu.edu/about/

The NYU Center for Data Science is a focal point for New York University’s university-wide initiative in data science and statistics. 
The Center was established to help advance NYU’s goal of creating the country’s leading data science training and research facilities, 
and arming researchers and professionals with tools to harness the power of big data. The Center’s faculty members and scientists are
established experts in the field of data science. Their interests are primarily in mathematical statistics, computational statistics 
and machine learning, optimization and large-scale computation, system design for large-scale data science, and several application areas,
such as artificial intelligence, computational biology, computational economics, or quantitative methods in social science. Because of
the interdisciplinary nature of data science, the Center collaborates with many departments within NYU, including anthropology, biology,
business, computer science, economics, education, information systems, law, linguistics, mathematics, physics, politics, psychology, 
public health and sociology. As it grows,the Center will attract new scientists and graduate students whose primary research and
teaching activities revolve around data science.
