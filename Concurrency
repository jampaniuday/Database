What is Concurrency in a Database?
 
Databases are confusing! Not only are they complicated bits of software, but database jargon is really complicated. 
Part of this comes from the number of words that have multiple meanings: depending on which community you spend time in,
there are multiple meanings for words like schema, cluster, and even database.

Concurrency is one of those words! Concurrency comes from words that mean, roughly, “to run together.”
