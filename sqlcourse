What is SQL?
SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. 
According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems.
SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. 
Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. 
Although most database systems use SQL, most of them also have their own additional proprietary extensions that are usually only 
used on their system. However, the standard SQL commands such as "Select", "Insert", "Update", "Delete", "Create", and "Drop" can
be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database. This tutorial will provide you with the instruction 
on the basics of each of these commands as well as allow you to put them to practice using the SQL Interpreter.
