Database Systems Research Group

Welcome to the Database Systems Research Group at Heidelberg University. 
Our research is centered around the management, processing, and analysis of complex data, ranging from spatial, temporal, 
and spatio-temporal data to large-scale evolving network data. Research topics include

Information extraction

Event detection and analysis

Spatial and spatio-temporal data mining

Text mining

Complex network analysis

Details about current and past research projects can be found here. Many of the research projects are interdisciplinary,
covering application areas such as medicine, politics, economy, physics, and biology.

The group offers several classes, seminars, and practicals at the introductory and advanced level. 
Besides an introductory course to database systems at the bachelor level, at the graduate level we offer courses on Knowledge Discovery 
in Databases, Complex Network Analysis, Spatial Databases, and Data Warehouses. A complete list of current and past courses and seminars 
can be found here. 

Students interested in joining the group for a bachelor or master thesis or some interesting research 
project (introductory or advanced practical) can find some more information here.

Important note for international students interested in an internship: The group does not take any more 
international students for an internship for the academic year 2018. Emails asking for an internship for 
that time period are very likely to remain unanswered.
