MySQL Cluster 
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/

MySQL Cluster is a write-scalable, real-time, ACID-compliant transactional database, designed to deliver 99.9999% availability. 
With a distributed, multi-master architecture and no single point of failure, MySQL Cluster scales horizontally on commodity
hardware with auto-sharding (partitioning) to serve read and write intensive workloads, accessed via SQL and NoSQL interfaces.

It is available as both open source and commercial editions. The Community (OSS) Edition is available under the free software/opensource 
GNU General Public License (commonly known as the "GPL"). MySQL Cluster is provided as a separate download so that users can have access
to builds from the latest source releases of the MySQL Cluster Carrier Grade Edition (https://www.mysql.com/downloads/clustercge/).
