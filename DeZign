DeZign for Databases
Data modeling for database professionals.

Visualize database structures to understand your database, create new databases or 
reverse-engineer existing databases to modify, document, analyze, and optimize.


Model-Driven Collaboration
If you need to develop large models with many modelers, you might prefer to store your 
model in a (server-based) repository database. The Datanamic Repository is a central 
epository database to store your data models. With the Datanamic Repository more than 
one user can work on the same data model. You can connect to the Datanamic Repository 
with the Expert Edition of DeZign for Databases.
